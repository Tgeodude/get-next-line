To be able to manage multiple file descriptors with your get_next_line. For
example, if the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5 are accessible for reading, then you can
call get_next_line once on 3, once on 4, once again on 3 then once on 5 etc.
without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors.
